Deep Learning Notebooks on Kaggle

This repo contains several deep learning projects of me when I was learning DL:

--Text Review Classification – classify product reviews based on text using RNN models.

--Dog Image Classification – image classification with CNNs.

--Titanic Survival Prediction – predict passenger survival with deep learning.

--Astronomy Planet Classification – classify celestial objects from astronomical data.

Each project is a Jupyter Notebook. Kaggle link:https://www.kaggle.com/streamsong/code
